# Hinter

Terminal User Interface for a simple key-value store. The original intent was to use it for storing _hints_ about a particular issue/problem, hence the name.

## Disclaimer
- This is a fun project. I am primarily doing this to become more fluent in functional programming.

## Planned features
- [ ] Add key-value pair
- [ ] Remove key-value pair
- [ ] Search engine
- [ ] Some concept of namespaces, topics, labels
- [ ] Option to use remote storage for sharing among colleagues

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `hinter` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:hinter, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/hinter](https://hexdocs.pm/hinter).
